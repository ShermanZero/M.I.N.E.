<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Currency as we knew it became meaningless, and value became an ever-moving bestowal placed only into unique materials which helped rapidly advance humanity. A galactic republic comprised of four major groups was formed. It became jointly known as <strong>M<sup>aterials</sup> I<sup>nnovation</sup> N<sup>ature</sup> E<sup>nergy</sup></strong>, simplified to <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as M.I.N.E.">MatInNaEn</abbr></strong> or <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong>.  While civilians of <strong>InNaEn</strong> continued to work on Earth to maintain our beloved planet, members of <strong>Mat</strong> became intergalactic explorers, recruited to provide the materials that civilization depended on.  In turn, a cycle was born, and <strong>Mat</strong> became sustained through the advancements of <strong>InNaEn</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the founding group of <strong>M.I.N.E</strong>, technology stemmed from <strong>In</strong>.   Thanks to <strong>In</strong>, the value of materials was discovered, which opened the floodgates to an explosive technology boom.   After only a decade, <strong>Mat</strong> was formed to co-exist with <strong>In</strong>.  Latest tech allowed explorers to quickly scout the surrounding planets, extracting planetary information.  This proved invaluable, as a once hope-for-the-best approach quickly transitioned to logical and systematic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Na</strong> came around shortly after <strong>Mat</strong>.  The transition from small to large material influx sparked widespread fear of galactic resource depletion, and the harmful effects of planet scavenging.  Demanding answers, citizens protested globally until <strong>Na</strong> was formed.  Constant research of sustainability and environmental conservation yielded a protocol ensuring the people’s galaxy would be infinitely-sustainable.  <strong>Na</strong> became responsible for the education and enforcement of this protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>En</strong> existed long before other groups, but burgeoned in importance after discovering what they coined as <strong><abbr title="Coined by In, crenergy is &quot;created energy&quot; when in reality it isn't &quot;created&quot; at all">crenergy</abbr></strong> or “created energy.”  In reality, it wasn’t “created energy” at all, but instead an extremely efficient conversion between materials and energy.  Crenergy became so powerful, it exponentially surpassed even nuclear fission, and became humanity’s one and only source of energy.  <strong>En</strong> became assimilated into <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong> as <strong>Mat</strong> was formed to support the near-constant intergalactic travel of explorers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over centuries, <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong> has continued to maintain equilibrium and while generations come and go, <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong> remains the same.  The game places players into the heart of a booming economy as <strong>Material</strong> recruits.  With help of the newest innovation, <strong><abbr title="An operating system &quot;designed for the curious&quot; with built-in G.E.M. connection.  Created by Innovation, it aids explorers on their intergalactic journey and path to fame">QriOS</abbr></strong>, an operating system “designed for the curious”, players explore the infinite possibilities awaiting them at the heart of <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong>.  Fueled by their own determination and promises of riches and fame, recruits set out to become the ultimate explorer.</p>

<p>While <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong> has lore (which will continue to be developed), the game itself is not a story-driven experience and should follow a basic core loop.  The player starts at a HUB, selects and joins a mission, explores, gathers/trades/sells materials, and returns to the HUB.  Upgrades, rewards, and leveling keep the player engaged - always striving towards becoming the wealthiest explorer in <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as MatInNaEn">M.I.N.E.</abbr></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon joining the experience, players spawn into a central “HUB” located deep in the vastness of space.   It is the visual representation of <strong>Mat</strong>’s base of operations.  The interior is decorated with futuristic technology.  Life-support machines can be seen actively running to produce oxygen.  Billboard-screens hanging throughout the HUB display relevant information about the <strong><abbr title="The Galactic Exchange Market maintained and operated by all groups of M.I.N.E.">G.E.M.</abbr></strong> (Galactic Exchange Market), and nearby planets available to launch to.  Shops are scattered throughout that contain purchasable in-game-currency cosmetic items and upgrades.  Native Robux purchasable cosmetic items can be found in specific shops as well.  Upgrades are locked to in-game currency only, and players will not be offered any game-changing advantages by spending real-world money/Robux.</p>
<p>Every player (member of <strong>Mat</strong>) begins their experience with a <strong>Mat</strong>-issued tablet.  Their tablet is their main source of interaction with global game mechanics such as joining worlds, selling/trading materials, player interaction, etc.  As a unified UI, it will behave similarly to a web-based SPA (Single Page Application) where every interactable-resource they need can be found within one root-reactive UI element.  For convenience, different “pages” will be bound to controls which will bring up the specific “page” in the tablet without the need for the player to scroll through their tablet.</p>
<p>Players will be able to join planet “missions” which are randomly generated every few seconds.   From a backend perspective, if a mission has no players, it will be discarded and its memory will be freed.  A mission with at least one player will teleport all players who joined it to a private server, or from the frontend perspective, the planet.  A brief arrival animation should play which allows the player to look out of an arrival pod as they descend and land on the planet.  Their movement controls will be locked, and their camera will be restricted to natural head movements from a seated position.  When the pod lands, its hydraulic door will open, and the player will regain control of their character, free to explore the planet.</p>
<p>On a planet, materials should be scattered throughout and available to gather.  As a planet, it should maintain a large sense of scale unless directly specified otherwise by the game itself through UI.  Players should feel a need and desire to explore, and every planet should be unique in its own way.</p>
<p>Players have a loosely-set amount of time to explore a planet.  They must keep track of their oxygen and make sure they arrive back to their pod before their <strong><abbr title="The Atmospheric Intake Recycler filters toxins from the air, allowing explorers to breathe on planets for a short time">A.I.R.</abbr></strong> (Atmospheric Intake Recycler) filter becomes fully used.  If they don’t make it back, they will “faint” and an “extraction team” will save them at the cost of all gathered materials.</p>
<p>Upon a successful return to their pod, players will be prompted with the option to launch from the planet and return to the HUB with what they have gathered.</p>
<p>At the HUB, players can find material-grinding machines which turns materials into fine dust.   This dust is the core of what’s used by <strong>En</strong> to power all operations of <strong><abbr title="The galactic republic comprised of the four major groups: Materials, Innovation, Nature, and Energy, also known as M.I.N.E.">MatInNaEn</abbr></strong> and is the most valuable resource known to humanity.  As such, in-game currency is exchanged for material dust through the <strong><abbr title="The Galactic Exchange Market maintained and operated by all groups of M.I.N.E.">G.E.M.</abbr></strong>, which provides the player with opportunities to purchase upgrades.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The player’s tablet is the primary form of interaction with game systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players must keep track of their oxygen levels when on planets to safely return to the HUB.  Different planets contain different atmospheres, and as a result players’ <strong><abbr title="The Atmospheric Intake Recycler filters toxins from the air, allowing explorers to breathe on planets for a short time">A.I.R.</abbr></strong> efficiency will vary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can sprint at any time, but on planets this will affect their oxygen consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planets are pseudo-randomly generated within a defined set of rules.  Different types of planets will produce different results in terrain, environment, atmosphere, and materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planets contain randomly scattered nodes.  Nodes contain materials.  Players can gather these materials up to a certain amount per their backpack capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can deposit collected materials into grinding machines which produce material dust.  Players can sell this dust on the <strong><abbr title="The Galactic Exchange Market maintained and operated by all groups of M.I.N.E.">G.E.M.</abbr></strong> for in-game currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-game currency can be used to purchase cosmetics or upgrades which help the player advance further and faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players have an “explorer level” to stack themselves up against other players.  This mechanic is conceptual and its interaction with the game will be developed alongside the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Players should be able to bind custom controls to most, if not all, actions for PC and console.  Specific game quality settings should also be available such as post-processing effects and field of view.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The HUB will be a static environment populated with sci-fi tech and miscellaneous (undetermined) objects which fit the theme of the game.</p>
<p>Planets, being procedurally generated, will follow constrained random rules localized to the type of planet.  For example, a dry planet would have a reddish-yellowish color, little-to-no water, and potential dust-storms, whereas a wet planet would be luscious and vibrant, filled with nature, and oxygen-rich.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<h3 id="visual">Visual</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The majority of interactive UI should be contained within the player’s tablet.  Players will be able to scroll/swipe through the different tablet “pages” like they would do in a SPA.  Some UI elements are reactive and dynamically populated by the game, such as available missions.  Some default Roblox UI will be disabled, such as connected players and backpack, which will have their own stylized implementations to fit the look and feel of the game.</p>
<p>Other non-interactive UI elements should be limited only to display relevant information at their corresponding relevant times.  For example, the player’s inventory should almost always be displayed because knowing the current state of their inventory is important to players at almost all times.  These static UI elements should be condensed as much as possible to provide clear information with minimal clutter.  This will be especially advantageous to mobile players, who won’t have the screen size to display tons of content.</p>
<p>Even still, the mobile UI will most likely require even more simplification to give the mobile users as much screen real-estate as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>From a web-design perspective, SPAs are taking over the internet and rightly so.  Not only are they versatile, but performant as well.  Filled with reactive elements, SPAs allow the client to render individual elements dynamically at their time of need.  Similarly, the backend UI will closely follow this approach.  Many elements will need to be dynamically generated as-needed, and each individual element should belong within a group.  These groups end up displayed as tablet “pages” which player’s can navigate through using their local and preferred controls.</p>
<p>Reactive/dynamic elements will be instantiated at runtime from prefabs and populate their corresponding groups.</p>
<p>Hybrid UI elements (such as player inventory) can have dynamic attributes, but remain unchanging at their core.  For example, the player inventory only needs to display what the player currently has, versus what the player <em>could</em> have.  To further clarify, let’s say <em><strong>X</strong></em>, <em><strong>Y</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Z</strong></em> are all possible materials.  A player might have <em><strong>10 X</strong></em> and <em><strong>7 Y</strong></em>, but no <em><strong>Z</strong></em>.  Omitting <em><strong>Z</strong></em> from the UI in this case allows for less clutter, and inversely, better clarity.  However, <em><strong>X</strong></em>, <em><strong>Y</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Z</strong></em> are all initially loaded in memory, and only updated when needed.</p>
<p>Another example of a hybrid UI element is the player’s <strong><abbr title="The Atmospheric Intake Recycler filters toxins from the air, allowing explorers to breathe on planets for a short time">A.I.R.</abbr></strong> reading.  At any given time the element itself will appear the same, but its contents (the actual numeric reading) will change.  The encapsulating UI does not need to change.</p>
<p>Static UI elements will be used sparingly.  An example of this would be the game’s build, which could also be toggled on and off.  For the advanced and enthusiastic user, having a referenced build identifier provides them with basic, high-level information about the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey I’m Kieran, and it’s nice to meet you!  I’m a solo-developer and a hobbiest at it, at the moment.  I’ve had the dream to publish my own long-term game for a very, very long time, but never the financial support to do so.  I’ve put many different projects and games out there, but they’ve been simple month-long or less creations.  The longest amount of time I’ve had to consistently work on a game was about one year.  I was working a full-time job, and when I came back to my apartment at the time, I would continue development on the game.  I repeated that pattern until I couldn’t continue to stretch myself thin, and was forced to refocus myself back on my only paying job.  I had attempted to reach out to publishers, but nobody was interested.  Regardless, that hasn’t stopped me at all, and I often spend my limited free-time either enjoying games or making them myself.</p>
<p>I consider myself a professional developer, even though I don’t have a fancy piece of paper that says so.  I have plenty of experience using a wide-array of languages.  I started my programming journey when I was nine years old (I’m 24 now) on a TI-84 graphing calculator.  Since then, I’ve worked with Java, C#, Python, Lua, Javascript, PHP, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, SASS, ReactJS, Svelte, MongoDB, and many, many more languages, libraries, and tools.  I’ve known for a very long time that my brain is hardwired for coding, and learning/using programming languages and concepts is undeniably my best skill.</p>
<p>I graduated 17<sup>th</sup> in my class with high honors from Messalonskee High School in Oakland, Maine in 2015.  I immediately went to the University of Maine for Computer Science, but my path didn’t go quite as I had expected, and I never finished that degree.  Instead, I dabbled in Cybersecurity, and eventually settled on Game Design at FullSail University.  I recently graduated from FullSail with a certificate, but I fully intend to further those studies when I can afford to.  Lots of my knowledge has been self-taught.  I can’t even begin to estimate the number of hours I’ve spent watching videos and free lectures, reading and posting to forums, and just diving into challenges head on.  For fun, I once tackled a company-issued challenge that had me create an algorithm to sort jugglers.  I ended up using it as my senior project, and I was able to find some old pictures involving that process linked below.</p>
<p>Throughout my entire development journey, I’ve been extremely self-motivated to learn just about as much as I can.  When I can’t learn a topic from helpful and friendly devs who share their expertise online for free, I start looking for the same information on paid professional platforms.  My goto has been Udemy, and you can find links to courses I’ve completed below.</p>
<p>I recently moved to Florida after marrying in 2020, and I live here with my lovely wife and adorable cat.  My wife is a big inspiration to me and extremely talented in her own creative aspirations.  She is a large reason behind this document and application, and we always push each other to accomplish our goals and succeed.  If you want to know more about me, please don’t hesitate to reach out through the contact information found below.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you for taking the time to read through this document!  I very much appreciate even the smallest amount of consideration, and hopefully at the very least something you’ve seen here impressed you.  It’s been my dream for the longest time to become a full-time indie developer.  At the start and end of every day, creativity is what drives me, and I’m able to express it through the many amazing tools available to all developers.  I’ve known about Roblox for a while, but I had never engaged with the platform or its tools until recently.  I’m happy to say my experience has been great so far!</p>
<p>Have a great rest of your day, and you can reach me at:</p>
