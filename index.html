            Currency as we knew it became meaningless, and value became an ever-moving bestowal placed only into unique
            materials which helped rapidly advance humanity. A galactic republic comprised of four major groups was
            formed. It became jointly known as

            members of <strong>Mat</strong> became intergalactic explorers, recruited to provide the materials that
            civilization depended on. In turn, a cycle was born, and <strong>Mat</strong> became sustained through the

            As the founding group of <strong>M.I.N.E</strong>, technology stemmed from <strong>In</strong>. Thanks to
            <strong>In</strong>, the value of materials was discovered, which opened the floodgates to an explosive
            technology boom. After only a decade, <strong>Mat</strong> was formed to co-exist with <strong>In</strong>.
            Latest tech allowed explorers to quickly scout the surrounding planets, extracting planetary information.
            This proved invaluable, as a once hope-for-the-best approach quickly transitioned to logical and systematic.

            <strong>Na</strong> came around shortly after <strong>Mat</strong>. The transition from small to large
            material influx sparked widespread fear of galactic resource depletion, and the harmful effects of planet
            scavenging. Demanding answers, citizens protested globally until <strong>Na</strong> was formed. Constant
            research of sustainability and environmental conservation yielded a protocol ensuring the people‚Äôs galaxy
            would be infinitely-sustainable. <strong>Na</strong> became responsible for the education and enforcement of
            this protocol.

            the visual representation of <strong>Mat</strong>‚Äôs base of operations. The interior is decorated with
            futuristic technology. Life-support machines can be seen actively running to produce oxygen.

            (<strong>G</strong>alactic <strong>E</strong>xchange <strong>M</strong>arket), and nearby planets available to launch to. Shops are scattered throughout that
            contain purchasable in-game-currency cosmetic items and upgrades. Native Robux purchasable cosmetic items
            can be found in specific shops as well. Upgrades are locked to in-game currency only, and players will not
            be offered any game-changing advantages by spending real-world money/Robux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every player (member of <strong>Mat</strong>) begins their experience with a <strong>Mat</strong>-issued
            tablet. Their tablet is their main source of interaction with global game mechanics such as joining worlds,
            selling/trading materials, player interaction, etc. As a unified UI, it will behave similarly to a web-based
            SPA (Single Page Application) where every interactable-resource they need can be found within one
            root-reactive UI element. For convenience, different ‚Äúpages‚Äù will be bound to controls which will bring up
            the specific ‚Äúpage‚Äù in the tablet without the need for the player to scroll through their tablet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players will be able to join planet ‚Äúmissions‚Äù which are randomly generated every few seconds. From a
            backend perspective, if a mission has no players, it will be discarded and its memory will be freed. A
            mission with at least one player will teleport all players who joined it to a private server, or from the
            frontend perspective, the planet. A brief arrival animation should play which allows the player to look out
            of an arrival pod as they descend and land on the planet. Their movement controls will be locked, and their
            camera will be restricted to natural head movements from a seated position. When the pod lands, its
            hydraulic door will open, and the player will regain control of their character, free to explore the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a planet, materials should be scattered throughout and available to gather. As a planet, it should
            maintain a large sense of scale unless directly specified otherwise by the game itself through UI. Players
            should feel a need and desire to explore, and every planet should be unique in its own way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players have a loosely-set amount of time to explore a planet. They must keep track of their oxygen and make
            sure they arrive back to their pod before their

            which fit the theme of the game.

            Planets, being procedurally generated, will follow constrained random rules localized to the type of planet.
            For example, a dry planet would have a reddish-yellowish color, little-to-no water, and potential
            dust-storms, whereas a wet planet would be luscious and vibrant, filled with nature, and oxygen-rich.

            The majority of interactive UI should be contained within the player‚Äôs tablet. Players will be able to
            scroll/swipe through the different tablet ‚Äúpages‚Äù like they would do in a SPA. Some UI elements are reactive
            and dynamically populated by the game, such as available missions. Some default Roblox UI will be disabled,
            such as connected players and backpack, which will have their own stylized implementations to fit the look
            and feel of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other non-interactive UI elements should be limited only to display relevant information at their
            corresponding relevant times. For example, the player‚Äôs inventory should almost always be displayed because
            knowing the current state of their inventory is important to players at almost all times. These static UI
            elements should be condensed as much as possible to provide clear information with minimal clutter. This
            will be especially advantageous to mobile players, who won‚Äôt have the screen size to display tons of
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even still, the mobile UI will most likely require even more simplification to give the mobile users as much
            screen real-estate as possible.

          <p>
            From a web-design perspective, SPAs are taking over the internet and rightly so. Not only are they
            versatile, but performant as well. Filled with reactive elements, SPAs allow the client to render individual
            elements dynamically at their time of need. Similarly, the backend UI will closely follow this approach.
            Many elements will need to be dynamically generated as-needed, and each individual element should belong
            within a group. These groups end up displayed as tablet ‚Äúpages‚Äù which player‚Äôs can navigate through using
            their local and preferred controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reactive/dynamic elements will be instantiated at runtime from prefabs and populate their corresponding
            groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hybrid UI elements (such as player inventory) can have dynamic attributes, but remain unchanging at their
            core. For example, the player inventory only needs to display what the player currently has, versus what the
            player <em>could</em> have. To further clarify, let‚Äôs say <em><strong>X</strong></em
            >, <em><strong>Y</strong></em
            >, and <em><strong>Z</strong></em> are all possible materials. A player might have
            <em><strong>10X</strong></em> and <em><strong>7Y</strong></em
            >, but no <em><strong>Z</strong></em
            >. Omitting <em><strong>Z</strong></em> from the UI in this case allows for less clutter, and inversely,
            better clarity. However, <em><strong>X</strong></em
            >, <em><strong>Y</strong></em
            >, and <em><strong>Z</strong></em> are all initially loaded in memory, and only updated when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example of a hybrid UI element is the player‚Äôs
            <strong
              ><abbr
                title="The Atmospheric Intake Recycler filters toxins from the air, allowing explorers to breathe on planets for a short time."

              ></strong
            >
            reading. At any given time the element itself will appear the same, but its contents (the actual numeric
            reading) will change. The encapsulating UI does not need to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Static UI elements will be used sparingly. An example of this would be the game‚Äôs build, which could also be
            toggled on and off. For the advanced and enthusiastic user, having a referenced build identifier provides
            them with basic, high-level information about the game.

          <p>
            Hey I‚Äôm Kieran, and it‚Äôs nice to meet you! I‚Äôm a solo-developer and a hobbiest at it, at the moment. I‚Äôve
            had the dream to publish my own long-term game for a very, very long time, but never the financial support
            to do so. I‚Äôve put many different projects and games out there, but they‚Äôve been simple month-long or less
            creations. The longest amount of time I‚Äôve had to consistently work on a game was about one year. I was
            working a full-time job, and when I came back to my apartment at the time, I would continue development on
            the game. I repeated that pattern until I couldn‚Äôt continue to stretch myself thin, and was forced to
            refocus myself back on my only paying job. I had attempted to reach out to publishers, but nobody was
            interested. Regardless, that hasn‚Äôt stopped me at all, and I often spend my limited free-time either
            enjoying games or making them myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself a professional developer, even though I don‚Äôt have a <span style="font-family: 'Sedgwick Ave'; font-size: 1em;">fancy</span> piece of paper that says so. I
            have plenty of experience using a wide array of languages. I started my programming journey when I was nine
            years old (<em>I‚Äôm 24 now</em>) on a TI-84 graphing calculator. Since then, I‚Äôve worked with Java, C#, Python, Lua,
            Javascript, PHP, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, SASS, ReactJS, Svelte, MongoDB, and many, many more languages,
            libraries, and tools. I‚Äôve known for a very long time that my brain is hardwired for coding, and
            learning/using programming languages and concepts is undeniably my best skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated 17<sup>th</sup> in my class with high honors from Messalonskee High School in Oakland, Maine in
            2015. I immediately went to the University of Maine for Computer Science, but my path didn‚Äôt go quite as I
            had expected, and I never finished that degree. Instead, I dabbled in Cybersecurity, and eventually settled
            on Game Design at FullSail University. I recently graduated from FullSail with a certificate, but I fully
            intend to further those studies when I can afford to. Lots of my knowledge has been self-taught. I can‚Äôt
            even begin to estimate the number of hours I‚Äôve spent watching videos and free lectures, reading and posting
            to forums, and just diving into challenges head on. For fun, I once tackled a company-issued challenge that
            had me create an algorithm to sort jugglers. I ended up using it as my senior project, and I was able to
            find some old pictures involving that process linked below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my entire development journey, I‚Äôve been extremely self-motivated to learn just about as much as
            I can. When I can‚Äôt learn a topic from helpful and friendly devs who share their expertise online for free,
            I start looking for the same information on paid professional platforms. My goto has been Udemy, and you can
            find links to courses I‚Äôve completed below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently moved to Florida after marrying in 2020, and I live here with my lovely wife and adorable cat. My
            wife is a big inspiration to me and extremely talented in her own creative aspirations. She is a large
            reason behind this document and application, and we always push each other to accomplish our goals and
            succeed. If you want to know more about me, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out through the contact

            The level loading was carefully scripted to make a memorable experience; this uses copyrighted audio from
            the game ‚ÄúIslands of Nyne‚Äù as a placeholder, and as such has only ever been shown privately to friends and

            Most notable is the work that went into the VFX and the bezier curves calculations to make a realistic
            approach; behind-the-scenes work involved custom collision-detection to ensure the pod impacts the ground
            and spawns a package regardless of the game‚Äôs current tickrate

          <p>
            First of all, thank you for taking the time to read through this document! I very much appreciate even the
            smallest amount of consideration, and hopefully at the very least something you‚Äôve seen here impressed you.
            It‚Äôs been my dream for the longest time to become a full-time indie developer. At the start and end of every
            day, creativity is what drives me, and I‚Äôm able to express it through the many amazing tools available to
            all developers. I‚Äôve known about Roblox for a while, but I had never engaged with the platform or its tools
            until recently. I‚Äôm happy to say my experience has been great so far!
          </p>
          <p>Have a great rest of your day, and you can reach me at:</p>
